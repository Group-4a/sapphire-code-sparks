In order to run our project run the following commands.

```console
git clone https://github.com/Group-4a/sapphire-code-sparks/ 

cd sapphire-code-sparks/

docker compose up

cd client/

yarn

yarn start
```

We have found that github does not preserve the Strapi user roles, so in order to update that in Strapi go to: Settings -> Roles -> Classroom Manager 
And under the Permissions tab click "Select all" for REPORTS.
